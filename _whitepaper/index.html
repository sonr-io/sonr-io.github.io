    <p>Sonr enables any device to share contact cards, links, and files with any kind of device around you, regardless
        of
        what platform its running.</p>
    <h2 id="-description-"><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Sonr sends files from any device to any device by using a combination of Ultrasonic Sound, Bluetooth, and
        Rendezvous
        Discovery in order to find all the available devices in the room. Currently if you wanted to share a file with
        someone nearby who isn’t running the same platform you would still have to upload the file to the cloud and send
        the
        link, or email the file directly to them hoping the attachment size fits. Sonr eliminates this by allowing any
        device to dropshare photos, videos, and contact cards without the need for uploading to the cloud, or needing a
        phone number/email address by using a completely decentralized P2P solution. It’s currently in private beta and
        I
        have sent it to friends and family, with a public beta being available by mid March.</p>
    <h2 id="-growth-"><strong>Growth</strong></h2>
    <p>I have plans for a multitude of features including: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The ability to backup transferred files by using FileCoin, so files that were transferred which weren’t
            locally
            exported, would never be lost.</li>
        <li>Create Circles where Users can create a group and share files with friends and family they have linked with
            an
            Invite.</li>
        <li>Revokable Files, Users can revoke viewing access from Files they have transferred without requiring a Cloud
            Storage Plan.<h2 id="-expansion-"><strong>Expansion</strong></h2>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I believe the groundwork laid by my method of peer discovery (which involves ultrasonic sound) and other core
        networking code would lead to a platform where developers can build their own decentralized applications
        effortlessly. In the creation of Sonr I have made sure to begin by creating a plugin where the core library is
        accessible through Flutter, Developers could easily implement this Framework in the construction of their own
        Sonr
        Enabled apps or services.</p>

    <h1 id="-why-"><strong>Why</strong></h1>
    <h2 id="-introduction-"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>Let us say you are with your friend and you want to send a video to them but, the problem is your friend has a
        Galaxy
        S21 and you have an iPhone 12. You try to upload the file to Google Drive to send them the link but you ran out
        of
        space and cant fit the whole file. Then you try to send it as an email attachment to him but still no luck, the
        file
        was bigger than the allowed size. This is where Sonr enters the picture. Sonr is a decentralized peer to peer
        solution for dropsharing files. With Sonr device platform does not matter and can run on any Desktop, Phone, or
        through a Web App. </p>
    <h2 id="-problem-"><strong>Problem</strong></h2>
    <p>Every current mainstream solution for dropsharing is completely proprietary with the current solutions being
        Android
        Nearby and Airdrop. In a deeply connected world where internet speeds keep getting faster having walled gardens
        for
        each platform make it more tedious than ever to share a simple photo, video, or url link to someone right next
        to
        you. The options right now are limited including using a cloud based provider like Dropbox or Google Drive to
        upload
        a file and send the link, but this raises problems such as: Not having the other persons contact information, or
        having limited space from the cloud provider. You could email or MMS to send a file but this also raises
        problems
        such as: Limited File Size or Once again simply not having the persons contact information.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Traditionally with File Sharing, a client utilizes a server to find peers within a certain area or network. This
        involves a STUN server to redirect traffic to the individual clients, transfers are then made by utilizing a
        wrapper
        on top of the transport protocol such as WebRTC - which limits capability by individual device. In Sonr by using
        a
        decentralized P2P model, individual devices can relay much more information between devices which enables the
        point
        to share feature to work. </p>
    <p>When I had originally began work on Sonr it utilized this centralized model with a Heroku Instance running a
        Redis DB
        to relay device information, and a DigitalOcean droplet to host a STUN server. Initially, this worked fine until
        I
        had multiple devices on the network exchanging peer information - this quickly overran my server and became
        unfeasible. </p>

    <h1 id="-how-"><strong>How</strong></h1>
    <h2 id="-process-"><strong>Process</strong></h2>
    <p>The user simply picks the files they want to share and selects the person to whom they want to send it - <em>the
            peers device platform is a non-factor.</em> The peer then receives an invitation to begin a transfer and
        after
        authorization can view the file in their native default app or in the built in Sonr Preview. Users can configure
        Sonr to save media such as photos and videos to save automatically to their mobile gallery or a specific desktop
        folder. </p>
    <h2 id="-compatibility-"><strong>Compatibility</strong></h2>
    <p>Sonr clients have currently been tested on MacOS, iOS, Android, and Windows. Linux compatibility should be
        functional
        but requires additional testing. A client to run Sonr on the Web utilizing WASM should be available shortly
        after
        release. Since Golang allows binaries to be compiled straight to any architecture, the only thing to worry about
        becomes creating a client.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sonr Utilizes <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p">libp2p</a> in its <strong>Core</strong> module
            which
            allows all clients to be transport agnostic - meaning a device which can only use a TCP protocol would not
            cause
            any fuss with a device that can utilize QUIC, WebSockets, UDP, and others. This module is then packaged into
            a
            binary which can run natively on any platform. </li>
        <li>Currently the binary is being used to create a desktop application written in Go itself, and also used as a
            proxy for the <strong>Plugin</strong> module in order to create bindings from Java and Swift into Go. The
            <strong>Plugin</strong> module is then incorporated into the <strong>App</strong> which creates the
            beautiful
            mobile interface in Flutter in order to target as many devices as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Sonr utilizes a combination of Ultrasonic Sound, Bluetooth, and Rendezvous Discovery in order to find all
            the
            available devices in the room and presents them in the frontend.</li>
        <li>This procedure eliminates the need to have external servers to route users resulting in substantially
            reduced
            operating cost.</li>

    <p>With about 35 Gigabytes of data being shared by people every year
        The average American takes 1000 photos and 500 videos a year, with roughly 25% of that being shared to other
        people.
        Let’s assume a user will send about 15 Large Files a year be it for work or personal use. </p>
    <h2 id="market-strategy">Market Strategy</h2>
    <p>As Sonr scales users will benefit both vertically and horizontally. Off the bat just having a way to share files
        between all their devices without having to buy into an ecosystem provides immense benefit. As time progresses,
        having their friends and family using Sonr allows users to have a more tightly integrated experience.</p>
